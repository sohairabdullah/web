I'm a senior at Colorado College, majoring in Physics. I'm broadly interested
in Quantum Computation and Classical Electrodynamics. My past work includes work
in fields of: Electronic Circuit Design, Computer Architecture, Mathematical
algorithms for Physics and Computer Science, Complex Analysis, and Electromagnetic
theory.

<h2>Writings, Research, and Past Work: Papers, projects, and book chapters.</h2>
<ul>
    <br>
    <li><a href="https://git.io/fpbrQ">Computer Architecture.</a>
    <br>
    <br>
    Developing a power loss protection circuit for cache flushing in NAND hard drives
    in Axellio edge computing systems. The architecture ensures that data being written
    onto the NAND hard-drive in a write back cache mode will save the data currently in <thead>
    cache by allowing it sufficient current/energy to flush itself onto M.2 solid state drive.

    </li>
    <br>
    <li><a href="https://git.io/fpbrA">Numerical Analysis.</a>
    <br>
    <br>
    Developing Simpson's double integral algorithm to visualize volume integrals of
    functions that cannot be computed analytically. The code used is available
    at this github repository.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
    <a href="https://git.io/fpbrb">Complex Analysis:</a>
    <br>
    <br>
    Obtaining a family of harmonic mappings on the unit disk whose images are
    rotationally symmetric rosettes with n vertices, n greater than two. A family of harmonic
    mappings is analyzed. In particular, for a four sided rosette mapping, we obtain an embedded
    triply periodic minimal surface is obtained.
    <br>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
    <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~sanathd/dag-IZ-tmf.pdf">Ion Thrusters:</a>
    <br>
    <br>
    Considers the feasibility of using a magnetic field to confine the trajectories of
    dispelled ions from an electric ion thruster. This research paper was part of
    University Physics Competition, for which Jack Schrott, Nick Crews, and I got a
    Gold medal (top 1.5%). More details, and question statement, can be seen here.
    </li>
    <br>
    <br>
    <li>
    <a href="https://git.io/fpbrd">Mathematical Statistics:</a>
    <br>
    <br>
    Considers Fully Enumerated Bootstrap for Convolutions and Other Random Variable Algebraic
    Operations. The research paper can be found here. This paper also forms a chapter of
    Professor Andrew Glen's upcoming book.
    <br>
    <br>
    <li>
    <a href="https://git.io/fpbrn">Multihop High Frequency Radio Wave propagation:</a>
    <br>
    <br>
    Models the impact of seawater turbulence on radio wave transmittance, by analying <thead>
    interaction of electromagnetic radiation with the earth's seas or atmosphere (ionosphere).
    This research paper was part of Contest in Mathematical Modelling, of which Jack Schrott,
    Nick Crews, and I won an honorable mention. This paper is also the basis of my
    undergraduate physics thesis.
